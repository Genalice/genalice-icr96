# Configuration files

### Option settings to configure Genalice tools

Genalice tools are fully configurable to obtain the best possible data results. As a consequence, each tool has a series of options to allow customized settings. Adding multiple options to the command line can be cumbersome. Therefore, multiple option settings can be added as a single configuration file through the cmd_file option.

Each option is described as: `option_name=[value]` in a configuration file. Comments can be added by using the # character.
